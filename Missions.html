                the
                end of the game, the player with the most victory points is the winner. If both players have the same,
                the
                game is a draw. Victory points are scored for the following:<br><br><b>Push Them Back:</b> Starting from
                the
                second battle round, each player scores a number of victory points for each objective marker they
                control at
                the start of their turn. A player scores 1 victory point if they control the objective marker in their
                own
                deployment zone, 2 victory points if they control the objective marker in the centre of the battlefield,
                and
                3 victory points if they control the objective marker in their opponent’s deployment zone. A player
                controls
                an objective marker if they have more models within 3" of it than their opponent does.<br><br><b>Slay
